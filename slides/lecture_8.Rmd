### Addressing model issues

.large[
.question[
How should we handle each of the following issues in a fitted model?

* Violations of the shape assumption
* An influential point with high Cook's distance
* High multicollinearity in the explanatory variables

Discuss with your neighbor for 3--5 minutes, then we will discuss as a group.

### Asymptotic distribution of the MLE

.large[
Multicollinearity can cause problems in the variance of the estimated coefficients $\widehat{\beta}$. But what is $Var(\widehat{\beta})$?
