\noindent \textbf{Due:} Wednesday, November 9, 12:00pm (noon) on Canvas.\\ 

\noindent \textbf{Instructions:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Submit your work as a single typed PDF (you should not need to type much, if any, math on this assignment).
\item You are welcome to work with others on this assignment, but you must submit your own work.
\item You can probably find the answers to many of these questions online. It is ok to use online resources! And using online documentation and examples is a very important part of coding.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Distribution of p-values}

Let $X_1^n = X_1,...,X_n$ be a sample from a continuous distribution, with density function $f(x; \theta)$. Consider testing the null hypothesis $H_0: \theta = \theta_0$, with test statistic $T(X_1,...,X_n)$, and rejecting when $T$ is large. The \textit{p-value} for this hypothesis test is given by
$$p = P_{\theta_0}(T(X_1^*,...,X_n^*) > T(X_1,...,X_n)),$$
where $X_1^*,...,X_n^* \sim f(x; \theta_0)$ is a sample under $H_0$, and $P_{\theta_0}$ denotes the probability when $\theta = \theta_0$. In other words, the p-value is the ``probability of our data or more extreme'', if the null hypothesis were true.\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Under these conditions, the p-value has a very nice distribution: $p \sim Uniform(0, 1)$ when $H_0$ is true.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Argue that $p = 1 - F_T(T)$, where $F_T$ is the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of $T$ under $H_0$.

\item Using the fact that $F_T$ is a continuous, monotonic increase function under our assumptions, show that $P_{\theta_0}(p < s) = s$ for any $s \in (0, 1)$. Conclude that $p \sim Uniform(0, 1)$.

\item Show that if we reject when $p < \alpha$, then the type I error of our test is $\alpha$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Multiple hypothesis testing}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[2.] Suppose we now have $m$ samples $X_1^{n_1}, ..., X_1^{n_m}$, from distributions with parameters $\theta_1,...,\theta_m$ respectively. For each sample $i$, we test the hypothesis $H_0: \theta_i = \theta_{i,0}$. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The \textit{family-wise error rate} (FWER) is the probability of making at least one type I error in our $m$ tests. Suppose all our tests are independent, $H_0$ is true for all the tests, and for each test we reject $H_0$ when $p < \alpha$. What is the family-wise error rate?

\item Clearly, rejecting each test when $p < \alpha$ does \textit{not} control the FWER at level $\alpha$. The \textit{Bonferroni method} is a simple and popular method for controlling the FWER by changing the p-value threshold. When testing $m$ hypotheses, the Bonferroni method rejects for each test when $p < \dfrac{\alpha}{m}$.\\

Using the union bound,
$$P \left( \bigcup_i A_i \right) \leq \sum \limits_i P(A_i),$$
show that the Bonferroni method controls the FWER at level $\alpha$.

\item Simulate $m = 100$ samples from some continuous distribution, and test some null hypothesis $H_0$ for each sample. Simulate your data so that $H_0$ is true for every sample. Using the Bonferroni correction to control the FWER at level $\alpha = 0.05$, do you reject $H_0$ for any of the tests?

\item Repeat part (c) 1000 times; for each repetition, record whether you rejected $H_0$ for any of the tests. In what fraction of your 1000 repetitions do you reject $H_0$ for at least one test?
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Multiple pairwise comparisons}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[3.] Now suppose we have $k$ different groups we want to compare, and let $\mu_1,...,\mu_k$ denote the means of each group. We are interested in all pairwise comparisons of these means: that is, we test $H_0: \mu_i = \mu_j$ for every $i \neq j$. We want to control the FWER across all our pairwise comparisons.\\

We observe a sample $Y_{i,1},...,Y_{i,n}$ of size $n$ from each group $i =1,...,k$ (note we are assuming the same sample size for every group). Let $\overline{Y}_i = \frac{1}{n} \sum \limits_{j=1}^n Y_{i,j}$ be the sample mean for group $i$, and let $s_i^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum \limits_{j=1}^n (Y_{i,j} - \overline{Y}_i)^2$ be the sample variance for group $i$. Assuming the true variance for each group is the same, the \textit{pooled sample variance} is then
$$s_p^2 = \frac{1}{k} \sum \limits_{i=1}^k s_i^2 .$$
We reject $H_0: \mu_i = \mu_j$ when
$$q_{ij} = \dfrac{|\overline{Y}_i - \overline{Y}_j|}{s_p \sqrt{2/n}}$$
is large.\\

With $k$ groups, we perform ${k \choose 2}$ pairwise tests. One option for controlling the FWER is to test each hypothesis with a two-sample $t$-test, and
